# Explainable-Pareto-Fronts
[Code and full disclosure will be available after Thesis discussion 16/07/24]

This is a Computer Science & Engineering MSc Thesis about applying Explainable AI (XAI) to Pareto Fronts resulting from a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) solved via Genetic Algorithms (GA). The methods are appliable to any Pareto Front.

Explainability methods have the
potential to explain the relationship between decision variables and objectives for Pareto
optimal solutions. The application of these methods leads to the extraction of additional
information regarding the problem and the solutions themselves.
The aim is to provide a Decision-Maker with a tool that allows them to make a more
informed choice and the opportunity to refine the solutions proposed by the genetic algo-
rithm used.
